 * Don’t let objects talk to each other directly. Instead, let a mediator object manage all communication between them.
 * So objects become less dependent, more decoupled, and the system becomes easier to maintain.
 * 
 * Example:-
 * ✈ Planes never talk to each other directly.
 * 📡 All communication goes through the control tower (mediator).
 * who can land, who can take off and who must wait
